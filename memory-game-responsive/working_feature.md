I made changes to the .fruit-border, .game-container (position, width, max-width), I tried to mess with the game-grid attribute but it never seemed like it did anything, and I couldn't get the grid-template-column to work well for me so I reverted it back to normal. I then adjusted the other .game-container for when the screen is squares, trying to chagne the positioning and max-width, max-height, and width. These all only made minor changes and didn't fruit me anything website changing as far as responsiveness. I really couldn't make real progress on this and chatgpt always wanted me to wrap the game containers in other divs which seemed like an extra step that was too much.
